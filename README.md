# halexc-android-activityBar
Circular progress bar for Android. Looks similar to the "activity rings" on the Apple Watch.

# USE:
Include the RadialProgressBar.kt (and ProgressBarAnimation if you want simple animations) in your Android Kotlin project. To use this UI element in the UI-Builder, add the content of the attrs.xml file to yours (default: res/values/attrs.xml). Now, you should be able to add the RadialProgressBar in your layout. For an example on how to use this, check out the files MainActivity.kt and activity_main.xml!
